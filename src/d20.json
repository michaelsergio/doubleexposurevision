This isn't your typical day at the office. When people say they've been dealt a healthy dose of reality, they probably never realized that a pocket dimension to serve it up to them. Here on \"The Beach House\", you can party the night away and forget your troubles, or completely immerse yourself in the problems of others. Here, the Suicide Squad is on the loose, ARGUS is getting antsy, and STAR Labs is frantic and searching for answers. Another world just faced crisis and fell, and you just watched it happen. Maybe you're a survivor from a dead world. Maybe you left a great life behind for a higher calling. Either way, you're tending to the multiverse, man, and that ain't easy. Sacred Grounds Gaming presents Breach! 2 - A fan LARP set in the Berlanti/Kresiberg DC television universe (with some liberties taken with the canon). This year, we will be introducing a quicker combat system and a more player-centric character creation system. You can play a character from last year, or come in with a completely new one. Scientists, Refugees, Engineers, Soldiers, and Meta concepts are all welcome. Following our successes using RFID technology last year, we intend to continue to play with interactive electronics to enhance the gaming experience. Contact flarrowverselarp@gmail.com to work with us to discuss your concept or to inform us you will be returning from last year (please give us your name and who you played last year), or let us know of your intent to play a completely premade character. Characters can also be created at event L0006: The LARP Bazaar (Wednesday Night at 10:00PM). Costumes and props are highly encouraged, and required to play metahumans! </FONT><b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Thursday, 8:00PM - 2:00AM</FONT></b><FONT COLOR='YELLOW'>; One Round; All Materials Provided.

A DEXCON 20 EXCLUSIVE! It's been a long ride for the passengers and crew of the Rising Star since the destruction of the Twelve Colonies. Disaster after disaster has plagued the converted medical ship as it has ferried its precious human survivors away from disaster. But now the discovery of a Cylon on board and the uncovering of a mysterious set of coordinates is leading the ailing ship to life altering changes for everyone on board. For at the end of the next jump lies a planet that may hold their salvation...or total destruction. Welcome to the final installment of Tales of the Rising Star as it reaches its conclusion and join up to 75 players as they take on the roles of colonial survivors and military in the Battlestar Galactica universe and face the Cylon threat in this highly freeform game. What you see is what you get - interact with computers, engines, and science problems hands on. Players should have a fair knowledge of the (modern) BSG television series and come with previous LARP experience. Players from previous Double Exposure events can continue playing their characters, but new character creation can be done before game either by emailing the game designers at BSGRisingStar@gmail.com and join the conversation with our game community here on Facebook.

Utopia Descending is a science-fiction fantasy world that is part of an ongoing shared story collaboration between a number of networked chapters. The events of this Utopia Descending event are a part of our continuity, where You-Star potentials from around the world are coming to a massive social event that takes place whenever there is a very viable threat of epic scale. Utopia Descending uses three zones of engagement. The first Zone uses an American Freeform LARP area for those players just looking to role play in the focuses of socializing, political intrigue, and political manipulation. A secondary zone uses toyetic design for crafting, hands on science and research focused puzzles, as well as digital interaction. Lastly, there are locked combat zones which use a contact-safe combat system outlined on the Utopia Descending web page. The combat area will be a low light and intermittent light area. Our primary RP area will have music and neon lights, but the music will be kept to a lower volume to encourage social engagement and the lights will be solid state bright color LEDs. Players will be encouraged to set up character FB Pages as Fictional Characters so that they can live broadcast from their phones directly to their character FB pages. Remember: Higher ratings means more money for your IC company (and more perks for your character).

In this world, humans are not the dominant species. That title goes to Spirits, which are immortal, unyielding embodiments of belief. These Spirits gain magical powers and an animal-like form by aligning themselves with one of eight Aspects, natural forces with rigid belief systems. Humans live in isolated settlements and eke out an existence by appeasing and avoiding Spirits. You are a Shiny. Though you are born to a human mother, you are not human. And though you can draw on the power of the Aspects, you are not a Spirit. When you are just a child, a Spirit will come to your settlement to claim you. This Spirit will try to convince you to devote yourself to its Aspect, and if you do, you will become a Spirit yourself. Becoming a Spirit, however, robs you of your free will: every action you take will be dictated by your Aspect's moral code. Aurora is a game about discovering what you believe. Your beliefs, and how you choose to act on them, determines your access to magic, how the game punishes and rewards you, and ultimately, your fate. This is a playtest of a new RPG system. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Thursday, 8:00PM - 12:00AM</FONT></b>; One Round; All Materials Provided. Beginners Welcome; Serious, All Ages.

It is this very problem that leads to the formation of gangs, and other groups of like minded individuals - where you can get a little protection in exchange for a lot of freedoms. Or, if you're lucky, you complete a (possibly terribly) dangerous job for a wealthy merchant or noble for (a pittance of what it's worth in) coin. Make a good enough impression, and the doors will start opening for you. And so here you are, in a small backwood villa owned by a baron from Altdorf who uses it as a combination of a hunting lodge and an estate to go 'slumming it' with fawning sycophants. You've been treated to better wine than many of you have ever tasted, and await the pleasure of the Baron Von Bruenwald and whatever task he may inflict upon you...

First, though, you need to construct that building. Players each start the game with five roof cards, and they take turns adding walls and roofs to a single building. On a turn, you first place walls on the highest floor, then you choose a roof card in your hand and place it on the wall. Each roof card bears markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card. In addition, some roof cards force a player to perform special actions, such as placing a second roof, changing the direction of play, or moving Super Rhino to a new location on the tower. Keep your hands steady! The first player to build all of his roof cards wins the game. Alternatively, if the building collapses, the player who caused the collapse automatically loses, and the player with the fewest roof cards in hand wins. This event will be played with the GIANT Japanese set! <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Wednesday, 12:00AM - 2:00AM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided. Beginners Welcome; Fun, All Ages.

In this unique game, you are vying for influence in a kingdom under siege. Three seasons out of the year, you'll allocate dice you've rolled onto various royal court figures in exchange for items. These items can be used to help a player's future dice rolls, or they can help against the hordes of monsters and villains that attack at the end of every year. Of course, high dice rolls are better. But the game is ingeniously balanced, and a wily player will usually beat a lucky player. Expansions may be used at the discretion of the players. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Thursday, 11:00AM - 2:00PM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided. Beginners Welcome; Fun, All Ages.

There are cards with 5 different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards either ascending or descending. Like Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths, since the last spaces grants high points, but ending early gives negative ones. The game ends when a total of 5 playing pieces have reached the 7th space. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Thursday, 11:00AM - 1:00PM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided.

Since then, the Japanese Emperor has entrusted his court members with the difficult task of caring for the animal by tending to his bamboo garden. In Takenoko, the players will cultivate land plots, irrigate them, and grow one of the three species of bamboo (Green, Yellow, and Pink) with the help of the Imperial gardener to maintain this bamboo garden. They will have to bear with the immoderate hunger of this sacred animal for the juicy and tender bamboo. The player who manages his land plots best, growing the most bamboo while feeding the delicate appetite of the panda, will win the game. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Thursday, 2:00PM - 4:00PM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided.

The next player must then think of a word for the topic that starts with a different letter, press down that starting letter, and restart the timer. If a player runs out of time, she's out for the round. If only one player remains in a round, she collects the topic card. If players manage to press down all of the letters before knocking all but one player out of a round, the players reset the device, draw a new topic card, then start the timer again, this time having to give two answers for the topic – each starting with a different letter – within the allotted time.

In this game from Rio Grande, players representing different Mayan tribes place their workers on giant connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to different action spots. During a turn, players can either (a) place one or more workers on the lowest visible spot of the gears or (b) pick up one or more workers. When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker. Actions located \"later\" on the gears are more valuable, so it's wise to let the time work for you - but players cannot skip their turn; if they have all their workers on the gears, they have to pick some up. The game ends after one full revolution of the central Tzolk'in gear. There are many paths to victory. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Thursday, 4:00PM - 7:00PM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided.

Letters that are used less frequently have special abilities, increasing their power. When enough of the alphabet has been claimed, players finish the current turn, then score all money, stock and letter patents owned.

What makes the game of Diamonds different from other trick-taking card games is that when you cannot follow suit you get a \"Suit Action\" based on what suit you do play. Suit Actions are also taken by the winner of each trick, as well as at the end of a full Round of play. Whoever has the most points in Diamond Crystals at the end of the game wins!

The game puts players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world where most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters.

This means players are working together toward one common victory condition - but for each individual player to achieve victory, he must also complete his personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing.

Once any player gains the Queen's influence, a final contest occurs for the Pharaoh's favor. Favor of the Pharaoh tasks players with building a dice-rolling engine - not to mention adding and manipulating dice - in preparation for a final roll-off between all players to gain the Pharaoh's favor and win the game. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 2:00PM - 4:00PM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided.

Also, it might be a good idea to hire capable staff: cowboys to improve your herd, craftsmen to build your very own buildings, or engineers for the important railroad line. If you cleverly manage your herd and navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of Great Western Trail, you surely will gain the most victory points and win the game. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 8:00PM - 12:00AM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided.

Proud to be the host for this august world body, Switzerland invites its champion axe-juggling troupe, Les Bella Lieben Jolie De Von Giorno, to entertain the assembled delegates. Unfortunately, halfway through the demonstration, the Troupe goes insane and begins hurling axes into the audience, splitting head after head. The Secretary General calls for calm, but before he can order a recess, his cranium is split as well. The remaining Great Powers use the confusion to pass the gavel between themselves, conduct international business amidst the chaos, and generally try to shift the balance of world power while escaping a bunch of armed psychopaths. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 8:00PM - 10:00PM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided.

Basic lands will be loaned out as needed (please return them). The players will vote whether to \"draft\" (3 packs, about $13) or play \"Sealed\" (6 packs, about $25). 1 pack will be added to the prize pool for every 3 packs purchased. Please purchase packs from the Judge at the time of the event. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Saturday, 9:00AM - 1:00PM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Offered.

Lifeboat is a fast-paced card game of intrigue and survival. Players vie for the highest score when the boat reaches land — a seemingly simple matter of surviving with the most treasure. But each player has a secret love and a secret enemy among the passengers, and no one knows when landfall will occur. Will you help row, and thus have a hand in guiding the boat's course?

The Emperor is weak, challenged by the might of the Shogun. Test of Honour is a skirmish wargame played with roughly 10-20 models on each side. Players select their force before each game based around a samurai hero along with one or two loyal samurai companions, and a variety of clan soldiers. Battles are swift and bloody as players alternate acting with one of their warriors - moving and fighting to achieve the objective of the scenario, whether that be cutting down the enemy, defending an outpost or finding and protecting a spy. As you play through the scenarios your samurai will use new skills, and perhaps even take the shameful path of deceit and trickery to gain victory - such choices are the ultimate test of honour. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Saturday, 8:00PM - 12:00AM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided.

Each round, the players each select one card to leave in their kingdom as a \"relic of the past\" to help them in later rounds.

If you've had a particularly high emotional investment in the games and in the con, stop by debrief and we'll help get you sorted for the real world adventures ahead of you. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Sunday, 2:00PM - 3:00PM</FONT></b>; One Session; Serious, All Ages.<p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr>\nFor further information, click <a href = mailto:dexcon20@dexposure.com>here</a> to send eMail.<p>\n\n\n\n                                    \t\t</td>\n                                    \t\t<td background=\"images/inside05a.jpg\"><img src=\"images/inside05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"34\" height=\"200\"></td>\n                                   \t\t</tr>\n                                   \t</table>                       \t\t\t\n                       \t\t\t</td>\n                       \t\t</tr>\n                        \t<tr valign=\"top\">\n                        \t\t<td><img src=\"images/inside06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"607\" height=\"27\"></td>\n                       \t\t</tr>\n                        \t<tr align=\"center\">\n                        \t\t<td height=\"39\" colspan=\"2\" class=\"text2\" background=\"images/index59.jpg\"><a href=\"home.html\" class=\"link1\">Home</a> | <a href=\"http://www.dexposure2.com/forum/\" class=\"link1\">Forum</a> | <a href=\"events.html\" class=\"link1\">Events</a>                       \t\t\t| <a href=\"avatar.html\" class=\"link1\">Avatars</a> | <a href=\"http://www.psi-13.com/dexposure/gallery\" class=\"link1\">Galleries</a> | <a href=\"links.html\" class=\"link1\">Links</a></td>\n                       \t\t</tr>\n                        \t<tr align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n                        \t\t<td height=\"63\" background=\"images/index60.jpg\">\n                        \t\t\t<table width=\"100%\"  border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n                                    \t<tr>\n                                    \t\t<td><img src=\"images/spacer.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"5\"></td>\n                                   \t\t</tr>\n                                    \t<tr>\n                                    \t\t<td align=\"center\" class=\"text2\">&copy; 2017 Double Exposure, Inc.\n                                   \t\t\tAll rights reserved.</td>\n                                   \t\t</tr>\n                                    \t</table>\n                        \t\t</td>\n                       \t\t</tr>\n                        \t</table>\n            \t\t</td>\n            \t\t<td width=\"67\" background=\"images/index16.jpg\"><img src=\"images/index16.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"67\" height=\"200\"></td>\n           \t\t</tr>\n           \t</table>\n\t\t</td>\n\t</tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n</html>\n","status":{"url":"https://www.dexposure.com/d20complete.html","content_type":"text/html","content_length":702798,"http_code":200,"response_time":560}}
